# acblm

This R package is for estimating distribution of latent factors where unobserved heterogeneity is three-sided.  The model takes matched panel data as an input and allows unrestricted non- linear interaction between the three factors (eg. workers-managers-firms in paper). You can find documentation for the acblm package here [acblm documentation](https://www.chaudhary-amit.com/acblm/docs/index.html).

There is a simple example on simulated data here: [tutorial](https://www.chaudhary-amit.com/acblm/docs/articles/acblm_example.html).

Here is the link of github repository: [github](https://github.com/chaudhary-amit/acblm).

## Install directly from github

    #If needed  
    install.packages("devtools") 
    require(devtools)
    # install the package from github 
    install_github("chaudhary-amit/acblm")
    

    
## Using acblm package 

There is a working example included here [tutorial](https://www.chaudhary-amit.com/acblm/docs/index.html) based on `vignettes/acblm_example.Rmd`.
